# The world is quiet, but the Echoes remain.

Frequency Scavenger introduces a specialized gameplay loop centered around high-tech archaeology and signal triangulation. Using the Echo Analyzer, players must navigate the wilderness to detect and decode remnants of a long-lost civilization.

# Requirements
- [MultipleHUD](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/multiplehud/download/7530266) - Will not work without

## The Echo Analyzer
A sophisticated handheld tool featuring a real-time, responsive Pulse Graph. Watch the acoustic waves stabilize and peak as you zero in on subterranean signatures.

## Signal Triangulation:
Use a mix of directional alignment and distance tracking to locate buried caches. The tool uses a dynamic audio-visual feedback system, where pings increase in pitch and frequency as you approach the source.

## Seed-Based Discovery
Signals are procedurally distributed based on your world seed, ensuring that exploration is rewarding and unique to every save.

## Rewards
Unfortunately, I only had 1 day to spend on this mod, so I was unable to add the rewards I had wanted. These rewards were going to be the ancient machines that were left behind and giving off the echoes, here are a few:
- Ore Resonator (Locates ores)
- Biome Harmonizer (Locates biomes)

Instead I have made the rewards Hytale items, such as:
- Weapons
- Essence
- Memory Particle
- Under Construction Sign
